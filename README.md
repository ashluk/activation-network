# finalproject
ACTIVATION NETWORK is an ongoing project...a social network centred around collaboration. 
<br/>
<br/>
The main goal of the project is to connect artists and musicans to create collaborative visual works.
<br/>
<br/>
The inspiration behind the project is in the recent surge in the NFT market, due the NFT marketplace being a digital prime space and 
music being centred around physical experience many musicians are struggling to connect to these new platforms. The idea of Activation Network is to benefit both
the artists and musicians, up and coming artists can connect with more established musicans and promote works through their mutual fanbase.
